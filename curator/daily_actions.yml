    action: forcemerge
    description: >-
      forceMerge all indices older than 1 days and younger than 2 segments per shard.  
      Delay 120 seconds between each forceMerge operation to allow the cluster to quiesce.
      This action will ignore indices already forceMerged to the same or fewer
      number of segments per shard, so the 'forcemerged' filter is unneeded.
